Csharp_client-server_framework
==============================

This is a simple client-server framework I made as a personal project.
It should contain anything needed to get started with a client-server application.
Serialization is used for transfering data over the network and the objects are checked
for securing your application to only work with your own code and avoid "cheaters".
